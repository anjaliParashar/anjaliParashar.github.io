In this work, we extend the application of higher-order tuners (HT), as an optimization algorithm, for a class of problems with linear equality and inequality constraints. For inequality constraints, we propose a projection technique inspired from adaptive control literature, to preserve optimization variables within a convex hull with theoretical guarantees of convergence to minima for convex optimization.

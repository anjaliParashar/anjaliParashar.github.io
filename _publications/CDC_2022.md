In this work, we explore the application of higher-order tuners (HT), leveraged for fast convergence in adaptive control, as an optimization algorithm for a class of constrained optimization problems. We leverage ideas from the simplex algorithm used in linear optimization to prropose solution with guaranteed convergence to minimum for convex optimization with constraints.

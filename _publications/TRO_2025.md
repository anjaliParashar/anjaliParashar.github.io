This work explores the usage of end-to-end differentiable simulators for failure discovery and repair, combined with a gradient-based sampling approach (Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm aka MALA) for falsification and repair of data-driven policies in autonomous systems. We propose end-to-end differentiable simulators written in JAX for manipulation and self-driving tasks, and validate our sampling based algorithm, with

Failure discovery of robotic systems faces a unique challenge with the emergence of sim-to-real failures, that cannot be captured by simulation models, or analytically modeled to replicate in real-world platforms with ease. At the same time, simulation models share vital information about failures that will be replicated in real-world platforms. In this work, we explore a combination of sampling-based techiques and Bayesian Experimental Design (BED) to learn failure prediction models, by utilizing sample-extensive exploration in sim and sample-efficient failure discovery in real systems, supported by failures discovered in simulation.

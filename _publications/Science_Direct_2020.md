This work proposes an actuator fault tolerant controller for an underwater vehicle with four rotatable thrusters. Conventional AUVs have eight thrusters, which was modified in the design considered in this work with four thursters that can be rotated within a plane, allowing more degree of freedom under nominal operating conditions. However, loss of each thruster poses a higher damage to actuation compared to the conventional design. We propose a two-fold fault tolerant strategy to conitnue operations under various circumstances of loss of actuation.

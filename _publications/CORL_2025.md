Existing methods for failure discovery rely on explicitly defined analytical cost functions to characterize failures, often overlooking the underlying causes and diversity of discovered failure scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel failure discovery framework that integrates
contextual reasoning from an expert (human/LLM) in the failure analysis process, specifically tailored for high evaluation-cost applications. 

Our method incorporates expert-in-the-loop
feedback to construct a probabilistic surrogate model of failures using Bayesian
inference. This model is iteratively refined and leveraged to guide an active learning
strategy that prioritizes the discovery of diverse failure cases. We empirically
validate our approach across a range of tasks for high-cost contextual falsification
in robotic manipulation and autonomous driving. The project website is at

   caption="Generating failure trajectories for autonomous racing. We use VAE to learn a low-dimensional latent space, and perform 2nd order langevin sampling. Our method discovers edge case failures far away from the learnt distribution due to efficient exploration (right), and beats the random sampling baseline (left)"

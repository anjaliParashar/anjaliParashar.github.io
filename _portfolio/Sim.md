We explore the idea of using learning based techniques for improving the efficiency of sampling methods for failure discovery. Using a data-driven model to predict failures will only return failures that are observed in training data. Using such models as a pre-processing step, and combining with sampling methods allows generalizability beyond training data due to exploration.
